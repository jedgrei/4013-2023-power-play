ideas on how the whole thing is structured

subsystems:
- Arm
-- has 3 CANSparkMax (elbowLeftMotor, elbowRightMotor, wristMotor)
--- elbows should be run together always
-- 

- SwerveDrive
-- has 4 SwerveWheel (frontLeft, frontRight, rearLeft, rearRight)
-- has a ADIS16448_IMU (gyro)
-- SwerveDriveOdometry (odometry)
-- can be drive()ed with joystick
--- drive(x, y, r):
--- convert x, y, r to target positions for wheels
---- use SwerveDriveKinematics
--- setDesiredState() all wheels

- SwerveWheel
-- has 2 CANSparkMax (powerMotor, spinMotor)
-- has 2 RelativeEncoder (powerEncoder, spinEncoder)
-- has 2 PIDControllers (spinPid, powerPid) 
-- has an AbsoluteEncoder (absoluteEncoder)
-- can be setDesiredState()ed  
--- setDesiredState(desired):
--- optimize desired based on spinEncoder
--- get power and spin from respective pids
--- power wheels
